# Stars of the Future - Football Talent Analysis Platform

> **A full-stack Football Analytics Platform powered by Machine Learning**  
> Predict career potential for U-21 talents, explore player performance data, and build custom scouting models – all in one place.

**Live App:** [https://react-flask-psi.vercel.app/](https://react-flask-psi.vercel.app/)

## Overview

**Stars of the Future** is a comprehensive web application that combines **interactive data visualizations**, **machine learning predictions**, and **customizable scouting models** to help identify and analyze football talent. Built with modern web technologies and deployed on serverless infrastructure.

### Key Highlights
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Position heatmaps, pass maps, xG-based shot analysis, pressure-resistant metrics
- **AI Predictions**: XGBoost model trained on 15+ years of LaLiga data to forecast peak career potential (U-21 focus)
- **Custom Model Builder**: Choose your own KPIs and weights → the platform automatically trains and deploys a brand-new model for you in the background using GitHub Actions + Cloudflare R2 (no server timeouts!)
- **Multi-language**: English, Spanish & Catalan support
- **Real-time Training**: Automated ML model training via GitHub Actions (45-90 minutes)

## Features

### Player Analysis & Visualization
- **Position Heatmaps**: Visualize player movement patterns and activity zones on the pitch
- **Pass Maps**: Interactive pass completion analysis with field zone breakdowns and final third filtering
- **Shot Maps**: xG-based shot analysis with accuracy metrics and goal probability visualization
- **Pressure Heatmaps**: Defensive engagement and pressure resistance visualization
- **Aggregated Metrics**: Season-by-season performance trends with customizable metric selection
- **Goalkeeper Analysis**: Specialized metrics and charts for goalkeeper performance

### AI-Powered Talent Scouting
- **Default Model V14**: Pre-trained XGBoost regressor for peak career potential prediction (0-200 scale)
- **Custom Model Builder**: 
  - Choose your own KPIs and weights for impact and target metrics
  - Position-specific analysis (Attackers, Midfielders, Defenders)
  - Automatic training and deployment via GitHub Actions
  - Models stored in Cloudflare R2 for instant access
  - No server timeouts - training happens asynchronously
- **U-21 Focus**: Age-adjusted predictions for young talents
- **Real-time Predictions**: Get instant potential scores based on historical data patterns

### Custom Model Training Pipeline
1. **Select KPIs**: Choose impact and target KPIs for your scouting criteria
2. **Configure Features**: Customize ML features or use intelligent defaults
3. **Trigger Training**: GitHub Actions automatically trains your model (no server load!)
4. **Monitor Progress**: Track training status (45-90 minutes)
5. **Deploy & Use**: Model automatically available for predictions once training completes

## Data Source

This project uses **StatsBomb Open Data** – Men's Spanish LaLiga:
- Seasons 2004/05 – 2020/21 (17 seasons)
- Event-level data (passes, shots, pressures, GK actions, etc.)
- License: CC BY-SA 4.0

**Huge thanks** to [@StatsBomb](https://twitter.com/StatsBomb) and [@Hudl](https://twitter.com/Hudl) for making high-quality open football data available.

## How It Works

### Default ML Model
XGBoost regressor trained on 17 seasons of LaLiga data to predict a player’s **peak career potential** (0–200 scale) based on U-21 performance.

### Custom Model Builder
1. You pick KPIs & weights via the web UI  
2. Backend triggers a GitHub Actions workflow  
3. Workflow trains the model (45–90 min)  
4. Model is uploaded to Cloudflare R2  
5. Instantly available for predictions

No server timeouts – everything runs asynchronously!

## Security & Performance

- Rate limiting (1000 req/day, 200/hour per IP)
- Full input validation with Pydantic
- Secure CORS
- Structured error handling
- Automatic Render keep-alive (every 2h)
- Frontend retry logic for cold starts
